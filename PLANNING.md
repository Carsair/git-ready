# Future

* include images for extension
* include images for on page
* local storage, cookies, etc. for preserving state of comment (expanded/collapsed)
* probably want to do button on comments on the code not just "issuecomment"
* re-loop after someone submits a comment to add new button (need to check if button exists)
